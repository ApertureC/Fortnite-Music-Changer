# Fortnite-Music-Changer
Allows you to play music based on where you are in the game - At the title screen, Main Menu and at victory

# ~~ABANDONED~~ nvm back on it because im positive about this (thanks /u/PATXS) :
1. FNBRLeaks claiming he made it (Didn't include license and shoved "Developed by @FNBRLeaks" on it, got loads more downloads.)
2. Epic games has added it back


It isn't programmed very well, but it works (I used this to learn c#)

This could allow you to add the old music back.

How does it work?

It gets 2-3 set pixels on the screen, tests their color against what it should be for that menu, and if they match - it will play it.
